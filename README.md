## What it does

Omni puts all your conversations in one place, and gives you **Bots**: AI helpers that work in your chats for you.

- **One window for every chat.** Your WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack and other channels, side by side.
- **Bots that don't wait to be asked.** A message arrives, a group gets busy, a customer writes at 3 AM: the Bot you put on it acts. Ask for *"a summary of this group every morning at 8"* and it simply happens.
- **You stay in charge.** A Bot only reads the chats you allow. The first time it wants a new one, it asks you, and you answer **Once**, **Always** or **No**. Before it sends anything as you, deletes something or disconnects a channel, it shows you exactly what it will do and asks first, every time.
- **Answers you can use.** Bots can reply with lists, boards and forms that keep themselves up to date.

## Before you start

You need two things. The app walks you through both, and you can skip either and come back later.

1. **An Omni to connect to.** Omni is the service that links your chat apps. If your team or company runs one, ask for its address (it looks like a web address). You'll approve this computer from your phone; there are no passwords or keys to copy.
2. **An AI account.** Any one of: DeepSeek, OpenAI (Codex), Anthropic (Claude), Kimi, Z.ai, OpenCode, or an API key from a provider you already use.

## Install on a Mac

1. **[Download Omni for Mac](https://github.com/automagik-dev/omni-desktop/releases/latest/download/Omni-Mac.dmg)**. It's about 330 MB.
2. Open the file you downloaded (**Omni-Mac.dmg**, in your Downloads folder).
3. In the window that opens, **drag the Omni icon onto the Applications folder**.
4. Open **Omni** from your Applications folder (or press ⌘ Space and type *Omni*).
5. If your Mac asks *"Omni is an app downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?"*, click **Open**. Omni is signed and checked by Apple, so you only see this the first time.

You can then eject the Omni disk in Finder's sidebar and delete the downloaded file.

## Install on Linux

**Ubuntu or Debian (recommended):**

1. **[Download Omni for Linux (.deb)](https://github.com/automagik-dev/omni-desktop/releases/latest/download/Omni-Linux.deb)**.
2. Double-click the downloaded file and choose **Install**, or in a terminal run `sudo apt install ./Omni-Linux.deb` from your Downloads folder.
3. Open **Omni** from your apps.

**Other Linux (AppImage):** [download the AppImage](https://github.com/automagik-dev/omni-desktop/releases/latest/download/Omni-Linux.AppImage), right-click it, open **Properties → Permissions**, tick **Allow executing file as program**, then double-click it. If it doesn't start, your system may need `libfuse2` (on Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libfuse2t64`), or use the .deb instead.

## Your first five minutes

1. **Say hi to the octopus.** Omni opens with a short welcome.
2. **Connect your Omni.** Type your Omni's address and click **Get a code**. A QR code appears.
   - Scan it with your phone's camera. WhatsApp opens your chat with yourself, with the code already typed. **Send it**, and the app connects.
   - Or approve it on your phone with Face ID or your fingerprint, if your Omni offers that.
3. **Connect your AI.** Pick the account you have: sign in to Codex, Claude or Kimi, or paste a DeepSeek or other API key.
4. **Start talking.** Your **Main Bot** sees across your channels. Ask it something about your chats, or ask it to look after a group for you.

> Signing in to Codex, Claude or Kimi uses your personal plan with that company. Check their terms before using a personal plan for work. API keys don't have that limit.

## Updates

Omni updates itself. When a new version is ready, a **Restart to update** button appears at the top of the window. Click it when it suits you, or just quit Omni and the update is installed the next time you open it.

(On Linux, the .deb version updates when you install a newer .deb.)

## Your data

- Everything Omni keeps on your computer is in one folder: **`.omni/desktop`** in your home folder.
- Your chats stay in your Omni. The app shows them and keeps what your Bots need to work.
- What your Bots read and write goes to the AI account you connected, under that company's terms.

## Uninstall

- **Mac:** quit Omni, then drag **Omni** from Applications to the Trash.
- **Linux (.deb):** `sudo apt remove omni`. **AppImage:** delete the file.
- To also remove everything it kept, delete the **`.omni/desktop`** folder in your home folder. (On a Mac, press ⌘ ⇧ . in Finder to show hidden folders.)
